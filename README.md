Todoz* is a to-do project designed to help you get things done in a way and manner you prefer! It's a weekly to-do planner (weeks run from Sunday to Saturday) that will charm you with its funky and cute design, making you more productive with the assistance of useful notifications featuring descriptions that change based on your chosen *pussymeter* level.

**Use our PussyMeter to personalize your to-do list!**

Do you prefer a more gentle approach? *TodoZlatíčko* will be your kind friend.

Want something casual? *TodoZápisník* is at your service!

Need a kick in the ass to do something? *TodoZ*rd* will be your personal productivity bully.

We, the TDZ team, want Todoz* to be as much FUN and SIMPLE to use as possible, to get rid of boredom that leads to procrastination!

## Become a Todoz* Tester!

Currently, our app is in the free and public pre-Alpha stage, and you can already try it by clicking on this **[link!](https://todoz.gfapp.eu/)** We want Todoz* to become something pleasant and intuitive to use, so we welcome any criticism and feedback! You can provide anonymous feedback within the app or join our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/cP9Xa5TcuX)** community, where we share our production site and post current updates!
## Future Plans
We are planning to make Todoz* available for **self-hosting** so that anyone can host their own to-do list for free if they wish!
